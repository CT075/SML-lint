.SH NAME
hamlet \- faithful implementation of the Standard ML programming language
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hamlet

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B HaMLet
is a faithful implementation of the Standard ML programming language (SML'97).
It aims to be
.IP \(bu 4
an accurate reference implementation of the language specification,
.IP \(bu 4
a platform for experimentation with language semantics or extensions to it,
.IP \(bu 4
a useful tool for educational purposes.
.PP
The implementation is intended to be as direct a translation of the
language formalisation found in
.I "The Definition of Standard ML"
as possible, modulo bug fixes. It tries hard to get all details of the
Definition right.
.PP
.B HaMLet
can perform different phases of execution - like parsing, elaboration
(type checking), and evaluation - selectively. In particular, it is possible to
execute programs in an untyped manner, thus exploring the universe where even
ML programs "can go wrong".  It should be emphasized that 
.B HaMLet
is by no means a development system, but has been solely written with the
aforementioned goal of experimentation in mind. Interpretation is highly
inefficient (since it is a direct implementation of the semantic rules) and
error messages are very taciturn.
.PP
If no file argument has been given,
.B HaMLet
will enter an interactive session. Input may spread multiple lines and is terminated by either an empty line, or a line whose last character is a semicolon. The session can be aborted via Ctrl-D.
.PP
Otherwise, all files are processed in order of appearance.
.B HaMLet
interprets the SML Definition very strictly and thus requires every source file to be terminated by a semicolon.
.PP
A file name may be prefixed by @ in which case it is taken to be an indirection file containing a white space separated list of other file names and expands to that list. Expansion is done recursively.
.SH OPTIONS
The
.I mode
option controls how 
.B HaMLet
processes its input.  It is one of
.TP
.B \-p
parsing mode (only parse input)
.TP
.B \-l
elaboration mode (parse and elaborate input)
.TP
.B \-v
evaluation mode (parse and evaluate input)
.TP
.B \-x
execution mode (parse, elaborate, and evaluate input) [default]
.TP
.B \-j
compilation mode (parse, elaborate, and compile to JavaScript)
